    >A nanoparticle-based formulation composed of a microRNA 16 (miR-16) mimic, a double-stranded, 23 base pair, synthetic RNA molecule, encapsulated in nonliving bacterial minicells and coated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon intravenous administration and subsequent transfection, nanocell-encapsulated miR-16-based microRNA mimic targets EGFR-expressing tumor cells and facilitates the restoration of expression of the miR-16 family. This leads to the downregulation of the expression of tumor promoting genes and the inhibition of tumor cell growth. In addition, restoration of miR-16 expression sensitizes the tumor cell to certain chemotherapeutic agents. miR-16, a family of microRNAs, is critical to the regulation of gene expression and appears to have a tumor suppressor function; its expression is downregulated in various cancer cell types.</rdfs:comment>

    >A nanoparticle-based metal-organic framework (MOF) compound composed of proprietary X-ray-absorbing metals, with potential radiosensitizing properties. Upon intratumoral administration and subsequent irradiation of the tumor site, RiMO-301 absorbs the X-ray photons and produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen, which induces ROS-mediated DNA damage in the irradiated cancer cells leading to tumor cell lysis. In addition, RiMO-301 may also contain an as of yet unidentified immunomodulating agent loaded into the channels/pores of the construct that may induce an immune response against the tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) released by the lysed tumor cells, thereby locally killing additional tumor and non-tumor cells. MOFs, porous crystalline materials composed of metal clusters and organic linkers, generate ROS at much lower X-ray dosages than used in standard radiotherapy, which results in reduced radiation exposure and X-ray damage to normal, healthy cells.</rdfs:comment>

    >A polypeptide nanoparticle (PNP)-based small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutic directed against transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon intralesional administration, cotsiranib binds to both TGF-beta 1 and COX-2 messenger RNAs (mRNAs), preventing the translation and expression of TGF-beta 1 and COX-2 proteins. This inhibits TGF-beta 1-mediated signaling and abrogates TGF-beta 1-mediated immunosuppression, which may enhance anti-tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and promote a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells leading to tumor cell death. The inhibition of COX-2 prevents COX-2-mediated signaling, which may result in apoptosis and a reduction in tumor cell proliferation, tumor angiogenesis and metastasis.</rdfs:comment>

Upon intramuscular administration of sapecmeran autogene, the mRNA is taken up and translated by antigen presenting cells (APCs). Then, the expressed epitopes are presented via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of APCs. This leads to an induction of both cytotoxic T-lymphocyte and memory T-cell dependent immune responses that specifically target and destroy the patient's cancer cells that express these neoantigens. mRNA-based TSNA boosting vaccine is administered after a single dose of the adenoviral tumor-specific neoantigen priming vaccine GRT-C901.  The combined immunotherapy product, consisting of priming and boosting vaccines, is referred to as GRANITE-001.</rdfs:comment>

Upon administration of nab-paclitaxel/rituximab nanoparticle AR160, the rituximab moiety specifically binds to CD20 and targets this formulation to CD20-positive tumor cells. Paclitaxel binds to and stabilizes microtubules, which prevents depolymerization and inhibits cellular motility, mitosis, and replication. This leads to cell death of the CD20-expressing tumor cells that were targeted by this agent. The combination of albumin-stabilization and rituximab-targeting allows for higher efficacy and decreased paclitaxel-induced toxicity as it specifically targets CD20-expressing tumor cells. Rituximab may also induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.</rdfs:comment>

Upon intravenous administration of polymeric nanoparticle-conjugated CPT DAN-222, the nanoparticles accumulate in tumor tissue and CPT is released from the formulation at the tumor site and taken up by tumor cells. During the S phase of the cell cycle, CPT selectively stabilizes topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes, thereby inhibiting religation of topoisomerase I-mediated single-strand DNA breaks and producing potentially lethal double-strand DNA breaks when encountered by the DNA replication machinery. Compared to CPT alone, the nanoparticle formulation has a prolonged half-life and greatly improves the biodistribution of CPT resulting in an accumulation of CPT at the tumor site, which enhances tumor exposure while greatly reducing toxic side effects.</rdfs:comment>

    >An orally bioavailable nanoparticle-based formulation containing curcumin, a poorly water-soluble phytopolylphenol pigment isolated from the plant Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, with a variety of pharmacologic properties, including antineoplastic, chemopreventive, antioxidant, anti-angiogenic, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activities. Upon oral administration, nanocurcumin blocks the formation of reactive-oxygen species (ROS), neutralizes free radicals, and prevents oxidative stress and DNA damage. Curcumin possesses anti-inflammatory properties as a result of inhibition of cyclooxygenases (COX) and other enzymes involved in inflammation, and inhibits the activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB), and the NF-kB-mediated signaling pathway. This decreases the production of inflammatory mediators, such as interferon-gamma (IFNg). It disrupts various cell signal transduction pathways involved in carcinogenesis and prevents the expression of many transcription factors, and modulates the expression of many genes and proteins involved in tumor cell proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis. It also induces tumor cell apoptosis. It may also modulate the immune system, enhance an immune response against tumor cells, and may decrease regulatory T-cells (Tregs). This may prevent and/or inhibit tumor cell formation and proliferation. Compared to the very poorly absorbed curcumin alone, this nanoformulation may have greater bioavailability, an improved pharmacokinetic profile and increased efficacy.</rdfs:comment>

    >An imaging agent composed of silica-based nanoparticles labeled with a near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore, Cyanine 5.5 (Cy5.5) and surrounded by polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains attached to cyclo-[Arg-Gly-Asp-Tyr] (cRGDY) peptides, with potential use as a tumor-selective fluorescent imaging agent. Upon intradermal administration of the fluorescent cRGDY PEG-Cy5.5 C dots, the cRGD moiety selectively binds to alphaVbeta3 integrin expressed on tumor cells. Upon intraoperative fluorescence imaging, alphaVbeta3-expressing tumor cells can be visualized and the degree of both tumor metastasis and sentinel lymph node (SLN) trafficking can be assessed. Integrins are transmembrane glycoproteins upregulated on proliferating tumor vessel endothelial cells and various cancer cells; their overexpression has been associated with neovascularization, differentiation, proliferation of tumor cells, metastasis and an overall poor prognosis.</rdfs:comment>

    >A lipid nanoparticle encapsulating mRNAs encoding for the human co-stimulatory protein tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 4 (TNFSF4; OX40 Ligand; OX40L), the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-23 (IL-23) and interleukin-36gamma (IL-36gamma), with potential immunomodulatory and anti-tumor activities. Upon intratumoral (IT) injection of the lipid nanoparticle encapsulated mRNAs encoding human OX40L/IL-23/IL-36gamma mRNA-2752, the lipid nanoparticle binds to the plasma membrane of cells and releases the mRNAs into the cell. The OX40L mRNA is then translated by the cellular protein translation machinery to produce OX40L protein, which is then expressed on the plasma membrane of the cells that internalized the OX40L mRNA. OX40L binds to and activates signaling pathways downstream of its cognate receptor tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 4 (TNFRSF4; OX40), which is expressed on activated T-cells. OX40L/OX40 binding promotes increased cytokine production, which can induce proliferation of memory and effector T-lymphocytes against the nearby tumor cells. The co-administration of IL-23 and IL-36gamma further stimulates anti-tumor immune responses. Altogether, this may enhance T-cell mediated anti-tumor immune responses thereby killing of the tumor cells. OX40L, a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily, provides a co-stimulatory signal for the proliferation and survival of activated T-cells. IL-36gamma activates innate immune cells and promotes T-helper 1 (Th1) responses, whereas IL-23 has been implicated in Th1/Th17 immunity as well as in the modulation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs).</rdfs:comment>

Upon intravenous administration of the docetaxel PMs, the nanoparticles are able to accumulate at the tumor site due to the unique characteristics of the tumor's vasculature, while avoiding normal, healthy tissue. In turn, docetaxel is released locally at the target tumor site where it binds specifically to the beta-tubulin subunit of the microtubule, thereby stabilizing tubulin and inhibiting microtubule disassembly. This results in cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, thereby preventing cell proliferation. This agent also inhibits pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and induces various mediators of the inflammatory response. Compared to docetaxel alone, this formulation may enhance stability and improve delivery, thereby increasing docetaxel's efficacy while avoiding systemic exposure, which minimizes its toxicity.</rdfs:comment>

Upon vaccination, the mRNA-derived KRAS-targeted vaccine V941 (mRNA-5671) is taken up and translated by antigen presenting cells (APCs). Following translation, the epitopes are presented via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of the APCs. This leads to an induction of both cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)- and memory T-cell-dependent immune responses that specifically target and destroy tumor cells harboring these specific KRAS mutations. KRAS, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), is mutated in a variety of tumor cell types. It plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival and is associated with tumor initiation, metastasis and poor prognosis.</rdfs:comment>

    >A lipid nanoparticle formulation containing two small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for kinesin spindle protein (KSP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with potential antitumor activity. Upon intravenous administration, the siRNAs in KSP/VEGF siRNAs ALN-VSP02ALN bind to both KSP and VEGF messenger RNAs (mRNAs), preventing translation of KSP and VEGF proteins; this may result in growth inhibition of tumor cells that overexpress KSP and VEGF. VEGF and KSP are upregulated in many tumor cells and play an important role in tumor proliferation and survival.</rdfs:comment>

    >A nanoparticle-based formulation consisting of polymeric micelles encapsulating the taxane paclitaxel, with potential antineoplastic activity. Paclitaxel is covalently bound to polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based block copolymers which forms a micellar structure with an outer hydrophilic PEG shell surrounding the hydrophobic paclitaxel. Upon administration of the paclitaxel polymeric micelle formulation NANT-008, the nanoparticles are stable in the bloodstream and specifically accumulate in the tumor tissue. Due to the acidic conditions in the tumor and the pH-responsive nature of the micelles, paclitaxel is released in the tumor environment. Paclitaxel binds to microtubules, promotes microtubule assembly, and prevents depolymerization, thus interfering with normal mitosis. Compared to the administration of paclitaxel alone, this formulation increases the solubility of paclitaxel, enhances its specific retention in cancer tissue, and increases its therapeutic effect, while decreasing its toxicity. In addition, the micellar formulation allows the delivery of higher doses of paclitaxel to target tissues while minimizing systemic toxicity.</rdfs:comment>

Upon topical application of the BNP-encapsulating avobenzone/octocrylene plus diosmin/ferulic acid/cytisine/trans-resveratrol sunscreen, avobenzone and octocrylene absorb UVR and prevent exposure of the skin to UVR, thereby preventing the formation of UVR-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). This prevents oxidative damage to DNA, double-stranded DNA breaks and cellular skin damage. The other active ingredients may protect the skin through their ability to scavenge ROS.

Upon intravenous administration of polysiloxane matrix-gadolinium chelates-based nanoparticles, the nanoparticles extravasate to tumor sites due to the unique, hyperpermeable environment of the tumor vasculature. In addition, the small nanoparticles allow for deep penetration into the tumor, where they subsequently accumulate. Upon placement in a magnetic field, this agent produces a large magnetic moment and creates a large local magnetic field, which can enhance the relaxation rate of nearby protons. This change in proton relaxation dynamics increases the MRI signal intensity of tissues in which this agent has accumulated; therefore, contrast and visualization of those tissues are enhanced compared to unenhanced MRI. The ultra-small nanoparticles, less than 5 nm in diameter, allow for rapid renal clearance and reduced toxicity. Due to their magnetic properties, these nanoparticles make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.</rdfs:comment>

Upon administration, ceramide nanoliposomes accumulate in the tumor environment, due to the unique properties of the tumor vasculature, and easily enter tumor cells. This delivers ceramide inside the tumor cells, where ceramide induces apoptosis. Although the process is not completely understood, ceramide-dependent apoptosis most likely results from the downregulation of nutrient transporter proteins, which prevents cellular access to extracellular nutrients and causes tumor cell starvation. This selectively destroys tumor cells. Ceramide alone is insoluble and has a very short half-life; therefore, the nanoliposome formulation increases its solubility and half-life. Ceramide plays a key role in the regulation of autophagy, apoptosis, survival and proliferation.

    >A polymeric nanoparticle (PNP) formulation containing the poorly water-soluble taxane docetaxel, a semi-synthetic analogue of paclitaxel, with antineoplastic activity. Upon intravenous administration of the docetaxel nanoparticle CPC634, the nanoparticles are able to accumulate at the tumor site due to the unique characteristics of the tumor's vasculature, while avoiding normal, healthy tissue. In turn, docetaxel is released locally at the target tumor site, binds specifically to the beta-tubulin subunit of the microtubule, stabilizing tubulin and inhibiting microtubule disassembly, which results in cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, thereby preventing cell proliferation. This agent also inhibits pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and induces various mediators of the inflammatory response. Compared to docetaxel alone, this formulation may enhance stability and improve delivery, thereby increasing docetaxel's efficacy while avoiding systemic exposure, which minimizes its toxicity.</rdfs:comment>

Upon administration of nanoparticle albumin-bound thiocolchicine dimer nab-5404, this agent binds to tubulin and inhibits its polymerization, which blocks mitotic spindle formation and leads to cell cycle arrest and tumor endothelial cell apoptosis. This disrupts the tumor vasculature and leads to tumor necrosis. In addition, nab-5404 binds to topoisomerase I (TOPI) and inhibits its activity. This results in the inhibition of the repair of single-strand DNA breaks, DNA replication, and tumor cell growth in susceptible tumor cell populations. The nanoparticle albumin-based formulation permits the albumin-mediated endocytosis of the thiocolchicine dimer by tumor cells and endothelial cells.</rdfs:comment>

Upon administration, the Ad preferentially and specifically infects cells expressing the Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), which is highly expressed in certain human tumors, and expresses both TLR5 and a specific agonistic ligand in the same cell. 502S binds to and activates TLR5, thereby allowing for continuous TLR5 signaling. This stimulates dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes, macrophages and the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling cascade. This activation results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interferon alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and the interleukins (IL), IL-1 beta, -6 and -12. This may induce a T helper cell-1 (Th1) immune response and activate a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against tumor associated antigens (TAAs).

Upon administration of SVP-R, the SVP moiety is selectively and preferentially taken up through endocytosis by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), located in the spleen and lymph nodes, specifically dendritic cells (DCs). Rapamycin, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, prevents DC maturation, induces tolerogenic DCs, induces regulatory T-cells (Tregs), blocks activation of effector T-cells, induces B-cell tolerance, reduces B-cell activation, and prevents antibody formation, thereby inducing immune tolerance. When co-administered with a biological immunogenic drug known to induce the production of anti-drug antibodies (ADA), SVP-R is able to prevent ADA formation, which prevents the unwanted neutralizing effects of ADAs, increases efficacy of the biological drug, and permits sustained therapeutic activity and repeated administration of the biological drug. In the presence of a specific target antigen, SVP-R is able to prevent an antigen-specific immune response and induces antigen-specific immune tolerance. Compared to the administration of free rapamycin, SVP-R induces long-lasting immunological tolerance.</rdfs:comment>

This leads to cell death of PD-L1-expressing tumor cells that were targeted by this agent. The combination of albumin-stabilization and targeting by the danburstotug moiety allows for higher efficacy and decreased paclitaxel-induced toxicity as it specifically targets PD-L1-expressing tumor cells.

    >A nanoparticle-based formulation consisting of polymeric micelles encapsulating the taxane paclitaxel that are coated with the bladder cancer-targeting ligand PLZ4, a cyclic peptide with amino acid sequence of QDGRMGF, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration of the PLZ4-coated paclitaxel-loaded micelle formulation, the PLZ4 moiety specifically targets and binds to bladder cancer cells while avoiding normal, healthy cells. This specifically delivers paclitaxel to bladder cancer cells and, due to the acidic conditions in the tumor and the pH-responsive nature of the micelles, paclitaxel is released in the tumor environment. Paclitaxel binds to microtubules, promotes microtubule assembly, and prevents depolymerization, thus interfering with normal mitosis. Compared to the administration of paclitaxel alone, this formulation increases the solubility of paclitaxel, enhances its specific retention in cancer tissue, and increases its therapeutic effect, while decreasing its toxicity. In addition, the micelle formulation and the addition of PLZ4 may allow for the delivery of higher doses of paclitaxel to bladder cancer cells while minimizing systemic toxicity.</rdfs:comment>

In turn, docetaxel is taken up by tumor cells, and subsequently binds to and stabilizes the beta-subunit of tubulin, thereby stabilizing microtubules and inhibiting microtubule disassembly.

Upon intra-tumoral injection of MTX110, panobinostat is released from the formulation and selectively targets, binds to and inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC), which induces hyperacetylation of core histone proteins. The accumulation of highly acetylated histones leads to chromatin remodeling, an altered pattern of gene expression, inhibition of tumor oncogene transcription and the selective transcription of tumor suppressor genes. This results in the inhibition of tumor cell division and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. HDAC, upregulated in many tumor cell types, is an enzyme family that deacetylates histone proteins. Panobinostat is water insoluble and does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) when administered orally or intravenously. MTX110 solubilizes panobinostat and can be directly injected into the brain, which bypasses the BBB and delivers high concentrations of panobinostat to the tumor, while minimizing systemic toxicity.</rdfs:comment>

The RIG-I activating moiety activates the cytosolic RNA receptor RIG-I and induces RIG-I-mediated signaling. This upregulates interferon-alpha (IFN-a) and beta (IFN-b), and induces a potent IFN-mediated innate immune response against the tumor cells.

Upon administration of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine ARCT-021, the LNPs bind to the plasma membrane of nearby cells and release SARS-CoV-2 SP mRNA into the cells. The mRNA is then translated by the cellular protein translation machinery to produce SARS-CoV-2 SP. This may activate both humoral and cellular immune responses, and may provide active immunization against SARS-CoV-2 infection. SP, usually found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, plays an essential role in the infection pathway of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</rdfs:comment>

    >A synthetic microRNA (miRNA) mimic of the endogenous tumor suppressor miR-193a-3p formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), with potential antineoplastic and immune-activating activities. Upon administration, miRNA-193a-3p mimic INT-1B3 targets tumor cells, binds to its target sequence in mRNA transcripts, which leads to translational repression or mRNA degradation. This inhibits protein expression encoded by that particular mRNA sequence. INT-1B3 is able to downregulate many oncogenic signaling pathways, such as the oncogenic PI3K/Akt and Ras/MAPK pathways, and upregulate the tumor suppressive PTEN pathway. INT-1B3 also modulates the expression of cyclin D1, Mcl-1, K-Ras, c-Kit and TIM-3. In addition, INT-1B3 is able to modulate the tumor microenvironment (TME) through inhibition of CD39/CD73 and by downregulating the adenosine-A2A receptor pathway. This leads to a decrease in immunosuppressive FoxP3/Lag3 regulatory T cells and monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mMDSCs), increases the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and induces a T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune response. Altogether, this may induce cell cycle arrest and  apoptosis, increase cell senescence, and decrease tumor cell proliferation, survival, migration and metastasis.</rdfs:comment>

The formulation consists of an oil-in-water emulsion in which gemicitabine is solubilized in the excipient matrix containing a mixture of oil and (co)surfactants. Upon oral administration, gemcitabine is converted into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) and is incorporated into DNA, resulting in premature termination of DNA replication and the induction of apoptosis. Further, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and reduces the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis.

Although the mechanism of action has not been completely characterized, following intratumoral injection of lipid nanoparticle encapsulated OX40L mRNA-2416, the lipid nanoparticle moiety presumably binds to the plasma membrane of nearby cells and releases the OX40L mRNA into the cell. The OX40L mRNA is then translated by the cellular protein translation machinery to produce OX40L protein, which is then expressed on the plasma membrane of the cells that internalized the OX40L mRNA. OX40L binds to and activates signaling pathways downstream of its cognate receptor tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 4 (TNFRSF4; OX40), which is expressed on activated T-cells. OX40L/OX40 binding promotes increased cytokine production, which can induce proliferation of memory and effector T-lymphocytes. Altogether, this may enhance an immune response that promotes the killing of nearby tumor cells.

    >A lipid-based nanoparticle formulation composed of liposomes encapsulating a small oligonucleotide encoding a small activating RNA (saRNA) targeting the CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPA; C/EBP-a) gene, with potential antineoplastic activity. Although the exact mechanism of action through which saRNAs exert their effect(s) is still largely being investigated, it appears that, upon administration, the CEBPA-targeting saRNA MTL-CEBPA liposome targets and binds to a specific DNA regulatory target region, most likely the promoter region, for the CEBPA gene. This restores CEBPA gene transcription, and increases both CEBPA mRNA levels and protein expression. This in turn activates the expression of tumor suppressor genes and may halt proliferation of susceptible tumor cells. Specifically, upregulation of CEBPA in liver cells abrogates liver cancer cell proliferation, thereby prevents liver failure and normalizes liver function. CEBPA, a transcription factor that plays a key role in the regulation of the expression of genes with many functions, including those involved in cellular proliferation, metastasis and normal hepatocyte function, is found in many tissues, including liver cells, adipose tissue and myeloid cells. CEBPA is downregulated in certain types of cancer cells, such as liver cancer cells. saRNA is a short, double-stranded RNA that is structurally related to siRNAs; saRNA is most likely to bind to a target site on the promoter of the CEBPA gene and upregulates its gene expression.</rdfs:comment>

    >A formulation consisting of lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) targeting beta-catenin, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration of LNP encapsulating beta-catenin siRNA ALN-BCAT, the LNP formulation delivers the siRNA particles to the tumor cells where the beta-catenin siRNA targets and binds to beta-catenin mRNA. This results in the inhibition of the translation and expression of beta-catenin. This disrupts beta-catenin-dependent oncogenic signaling and prevents the transcription of Wnt target genes that regulate the proliferation, migration, invasion, and the metastatic potential of tumor cells, as well as genes regulating the immunosuppression of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Dysregulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is found in a variety of tumors and drives oncogenesis.</rdfs:comment>
