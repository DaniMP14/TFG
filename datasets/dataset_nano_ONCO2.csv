Upon intravenous administration, doxorubicin intercalates DNA, interferes with the activity of topoisomerase II, and causes DNA adducts and other DNA damage, resulting in tumor cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. This agent also interacts with cell membrane lipids causing lipid peroxidation. Delivery of doxorubicin in nanoparticles may improve drug penetration into tumors and may circumvent the tumor cells multidrug resistance mechanisms and may therefore be effective in chemoresistant tumor cells.",,,Pharmacologic Substance,GDC Terminology|GDC Therapeutic Agent Terminology|GDC Value Terminology|NCI Drug Dictionary Terminology|NCIt Antineoplastic Agent Terminology
C105613,C2150|C1557,Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Emulsion|D07001-F4,"An orally available nanoparticle-based formulation containing the hydrochloride salt form of gemcitabine, a broad-spectrum antimetabolite and deoxycytidine analogue, with antineoplastic activity. The formulation consists of an oil-in-water emulsion in which gemicitabine is solubilized in the excipient matrix containing a mixture of oil and (co)surfactants. Upon oral administration, gemcitabine is converted into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) and is incorporated into DNA, resulting in premature termination of DNA replication and the induction of apoptosis. Further, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and reduces the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis. Compared to gemcitabine alone, the emulsion allows for increased oral bioavailability and decreases its susceptibility to deamination and deactivation by cytidine deaminase.",,,"Nucleic Acid, Nucleoside, or Nucleotide|Pharmacologic Substance",GDC Terminology|GDC Therapeutic Agent Terminology|GDC Value Terminology|NCI Drug Dictionary Terminology|NCIt Antineoplastic Agent Terminology

DACH-platin micelle NC-4016 is prepared through the formation of a polymer-metal complex between DACH-platin and the polyethylene glycol-poly (glutamic acid) block copolymer, PEG-P(Glu). DACH-platin, an active metabolite of the platinum-based antineoplastic agent oxaliplatin, is highly hydrophobic and toxic when administered systemically. The use of polymeric micelles incorporating DACH-platin may both increase cell permeability and enhance the retention of the agent. This allows an extended half-life in the blood circulation and a selective and high accumulation of DACH-platin at tumor sites. This results in increased anticancer efficacy while reducing side effects due to DACH-platin toxicity. Upon intravenous administration and internalization by tumor cells, DACH-platin binds to and causes both inter- and intra-strand cross-links in DNA, forming platinum adducts and triggering tumor cell apoptosis.",,,Pharmacologic Substance,GDC Terminology|GDC Therapeutic Agent Terminology|GDC Value Terminology|NCI Drug Dictionary Terminology|NCIt Antineoplastic Agent Terminology

Upon intravenous administration of the liposomal docetaxel prodrug MNK-010, docetaxel is slowly released into the systemic circulation and accumulates at the tumor site due to the unique characteristics of the tumor's vasculature. In turn, docetaxel is taken up by tumor cells, and subsequently binds to and stabilizes the beta-subunit of tubulin, thereby stabilizing microtubules and inhibiting microtubule disassembly. This results in cell cycle arrest and induces cell death. Compared to the administration of docetaxel alone, this formulation is able to increase the delivery of docetaxel into tumors, thereby increasing docetaxel's efficacy while minimizing its toxicity. In addition, this formulation solubilizes docetaxel without the use of toxic solvents, thereby permitting the administration of larger doses of docetaxel while avoiding solvent-associated toxicity.",Pegylated Liposomal Nanoparticle-based Docetaxel Prodrug MNK-010,,Pharmacologic Substance,CTRP Agent Terminology|CTRP Terminology|GDC Terminology|GDC Therapeutic Agent Terminology|GDC Value Terminology|NCI Drug Dictionary Terminology|NCIt Antineoplastic Agent Terminology

Upon intravenous administration and subsequent transfection, nanocell-encapsulated miR-16-based microRNA mimic targets EGFR-expressing tumor cells and facilitates the restoration of expression of the miR-16 family. This leads to the downregulation of the expression of tumor promoting genes and the inhibition of tumor cell growth. In addition, restoration of miR-16 expression sensitizes the tumor cell to certain chemotherapeutic agents. miR-16, a family of microRNAs, is critical to the regulation of gene expression and appears to have a tumor suppressor function; its expression is downregulated in various cancer cell types.",,,Pharmacologic Substance,GDC Terminology|GDC Therapeutic Agent Terminology|GDC Value Terminology|NCI Drug Dictionary Terminology|NCIt Antineoplastic Agent Terminology

Although the exact mechanism of action through which saRNAs exert their effect(s) is still largely being investigated, it appears that, upon administration, the CEBPA-targeting saRNA MTL-CEBPA liposome targets and binds to a specific DNA regulatory target region, most likely the promoter region, for the CEBPA gene. This restores CEBPA gene transcription, and increases both CEBPA mRNA levels and protein expression. This in turn activates the expression of tumor suppressor genes and may halt proliferation of susceptible tumor cells. Specifically, upregulation of CEBPA in liver cells abrogates liver cancer cell proliferation, thereby prevents liver failure and normalizes liver function. CEBPA, a transcription factor that plays a key role in the regulation of the expression of genes with many functions, including those involved in cellular proliferation, metastasis and normal hepatocyte function, is found in many tissues, including liver cells, adipose tissue and myeloid cells. CEBPA is downregulated in certain types of cancer cells, such as liver cancer cells. saRNA is a short, double-stranded RNA that is structurally related to siRNAs; saRNA is most likely to bind to a target site on the promoter of the CEBPA gene and upregulates its gene expression.",CEBPA-targeting saRNA MTL-CEBPA Liposome,,Pharmacologic Substance,CTRP Agent Terminology|CTRP Terminology|GDC Terminology|GDC Therapeutic Agent Terminology|GDC Value Terminology|NCI Drug Dictionary Terminology|NCIt Antineoplastic Agent Terminology

Upon intravenous administration of polysiloxane matrix-gadolinium chelates-based nanoparticles, the nanoparticles extravasate to tumor sites due to the unique, hyperpermeable environment of the tumor vasculature. In addition, the small nanoparticles allow for deep penetration into the tumor, where they subsequently accumulate. Upon placement in a magnetic field, this agent produces a large magnetic moment and creates a large local magnetic field, which can enhance the relaxation rate of nearby protons. This change in proton relaxation dynamics increases the MRI signal intensity of tissues in which this agent has accumulated; therefore, contrast and visualization of those tissues are enhanced compared to unenhanced MRI. The ultra-small nanoparticles, less than 5 nm in diameter, allow for rapid renal clearance and reduced toxicity.

Upon administration, ceramide nanoliposomes accumulate in the tumor environment, due to the unique properties of the tumor vasculature, and easily enter tumor cells. This delivers ceramide inside the tumor cells, where ceramide induces apoptosis. Although the process is not completely understood, ceramide-dependent apoptosis most likely results from the downregulation of nutrient transporter proteins, which prevents cellular access to extracellular nutrients and causes tumor cell starvation. This selectively destroys tumor cells. Ceramide alone is insoluble and has a very short half-life; therefore, the nanoliposome formulation increases its solubility and half-life. Ceramide plays a key role in the regulation of autophagy, apoptosis, survival and proliferation.
