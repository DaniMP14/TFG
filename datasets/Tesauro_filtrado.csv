Upon intravenous administration, doxorubicin intercalates DNA, interferes with the activity of topoisomerase II, and causes DNA adducts and other DNA damage, resulting in tumor cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. This agent also interacts with cell membrane lipids causing lipid peroxidation. Delivery of doxorubicin in nanoparticles may improve drug penetration into tumors and may circumvent the tumor cells multidrug resistance mechanisms and may therefore be effective in chemoresistant tumor cells.",,Pharmacologic Substance,GDC Terminology|GDC Therapeutic Agent Terminology|GDC Value Terminology|NCI Drug Dictionary Terminology|NCIt Antineoplastic Agent Terminology
C105613,C2150|C1557,Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Emulsion|D07001-F4,"An orally available nanoparticle-based formulation containing the hydrochloride salt form of gemcitabine, a broad-spectrum antimetabolite and deoxycytidine analogue, with antineoplastic activity. The formulation consists of an oil-in-water emulsion in which gemicitabine is solubilized in the excipient matrix containing a mixture of oil and (co)surfactants. Upon oral administration, gemcitabine is converted into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) and is incorporated into DNA, resulting in premature termination of DNA replication and the induction of apoptosis. Further, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and reduces the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis. Compared to gemcitabine alone, the emulsion allows for increased oral bioavailability and decreases its susceptibility to deamination and deactivation by cytidine deaminase.",,"Nucleic Acid, Nucleoside, or Nucleotide|Pharmacologic Substance",GDC Terminology|GDC Therapeutic Agent Terminology|GDC Value Terminology|NCI Drug Dictionary Terminology|NCIt Antineoplastic Agent Terminology

DACH-platin micelle NC-4016 is prepared through the formation of a polymer-metal complex between DACH-platin and the polyethylene glycol-poly (glutamic acid) block copolymer, PEG-P(Glu). DACH-platin, an active metabolite of the platinum-based antineoplastic agent oxaliplatin, is highly hydrophobic and toxic when administered systemically. The use of polymeric micelles incorporating DACH-platin may both increase cell permeability and enhance the retention of the agent. This allows an extended half-life in the blood circulation and a selective and high accumulation of DACH-platin at tumor sites. This results in increased anticancer efficacy while reducing side effects due to DACH-platin toxicity.

Although the exact mechanism of action through which saRNAs exert their effect(s) is still largely being investigated, it appears that, upon administration, the CEBPA-targeting saRNA MTL-CEBPA liposome targets and binds to a specific DNA regulatory target region, most likely the promoter region, for the CEBPA gene. This restores CEBPA gene transcription, and increases both CEBPA mRNA levels and protein expression. This in turn activates the expression of tumor suppressor genes and may halt proliferation of susceptible tumor cells. Specifically, upregulation of CEBPA in liver cells abrogates liver cancer cell proliferation, thereby prevents liver failure and normalizes liver function. CEBPA, a transcription factor that plays a key role in the regulation of the expression of genes with many functions, including those involved in cellular proliferation, metastasis and normal hepatocyte function, is found in many tissues, including liver cells, adipose tissue and myeloid cells. CEBPA is downregulated in certain types of cancer cells, such as liver cancer cells. saRNA is a short, double-stranded RNA that is structurally related to siRNAs; saRNA is most likely to bind to a target site on the promoter of the CEBPA gene and upregulates its gene expression.",CEBPA-targeting saRNA MTL-CEBPA Liposome,Pharmacologic Substance,CTRP Agent Terminology|CTRP Terminology|GDC Terminology|GDC Therapeutic Agent Terminology|GDC Value Terminology|NCI Drug Dictionary Terminology|NCIt Antineoplastic Agent Terminology

Upon administration, ceramide nanoliposomes accumulate in the tumor environment, due to the unique properties of the tumor vasculature, and easily enter tumor cells. This delivers ceramide inside the tumor cells, where ceramide induces apoptosis. Although the process is not completely understood, ceramide-dependent apoptosis most likely results from the downregulation of nutrient transporter proteins, which prevents cellular access to extracellular nutrients and causes tumor cell starvation. This selectively destroys tumor cells. Ceramide alone is insoluble and has a very short half-life; therefore, the nanoliposome formulation increases its solubility and half-life.

This agent also inhibits pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and displays immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory properties by inducing various mediators of the inflammatory response. Compared to the use of toxic carriers to increase solubilization of docetaxel, protein-stabilized liposomal docetaxel improves drug solubility while avoiding carrier-associated toxicity.",Protein Stabilized Liposomal Docetaxel Nanoparticles,Pharmacologic Substance,CTRP Agent Terminology|CTRP Terminology|GDC Terminology|GDC Therapeutic Agent Terminology|GDC Value Terminology|NCI Drug Dictionary Terminology|NCIt Antineoplastic Agent Terminology
C91074,C1450,Oxaliplatin-Encapsulated Transferrin-Conjugated N-glutaryl Phosphatidylethanolamine Liposome|MBP-426|Oxaliplatin-Encapsulated Tf-Conjugated NGPE-Liposome,"A nanoparticle formulation containing N-glutaryl phosphatidylethanolamine (NGPE)-liposomes encapsulating oxaliplatin and conjugated to the human transferrin (Tf) ligand, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon infusion of oxaliplatin-encapsulated transferrin-conjugated NGPE liposomes, the transferrin moiety targets and binds to the Tf receptor, which is overexpressed on a variety of human cancer cells. Upon binding and internalization, oxaliplatin is released and its active derivatives alkylate macromolecules, forming both inter- and intra-strand platinum-DNA crosslinks, which results in an inhibition of DNA replication and transcription. By extending the circulation time and specifically targeting transferrin receptors, this formulation may improve the efficacy and safety of oxaliplatin therapy, compared to administration of oxaliplatin alone. NGPE, a reactive phospholipid, is used as a linker to attach the Tf ligand, to the liposome.",Oxaliplatin-Encapsulated Transferrin-Conjugated N-glutaryl Phosphatidylethanolamine Liposome,Pharmacologic Substance,CTRP Agent Terminology|CTRP Terminology|GDC Terminology|GDC Therapeutic Agent Terminology|GDC Value Terminology|NCI Drug Dictionary Terminology|NCIt Antineoplastic Agent Terminology

C95892,C67437|C176017,PSMA-targeted Docetaxel Nanoparticles BIND-014|BIND-014,"A proprietary preparation of polymeric nanoparticles containing the second-generation taxane docetaxel, targeted to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), with antineoplastic activity. PSMA-targeted docetaxel nanoparticles BIND-014 carry docetaxel within a matrix of polylactic acid covered with a coating of polyethylene glycol; embedded on the surface of the polyethylene glycol coating are ligands targeted to PSMA. BIND-014 allows gradual release of docetaxel upon degradation of the polylactic acid, and the PEG encapsulation escapes the host immune response while PSMA ligands on the surface restrict the cytotoxic effect to PSMA-expressing cells. Docetaxel binds to and stabilizes the beta-tubulin subunit, thereby inhibiting microtubule disassembly which results in cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and cell death. PSMA is a cell-surface antigen that is abundantly present on the surface of cancer cells and on the neovasculature that feeds a wide variety of tumor types.",PSMA-targeted Docetaxel Nanoparticles BIND-014,Organic Chemical|Pharmacologic Substance,CTRP Agent Terminology|CTRP Terminology|GDC Terminology|GDC Therapeutic Agent Terminology|GDC Value Terminology|NCI Drug Dictionary Terminology|NCIt Antineoplastic Agent Terminology

C98280,C129819,Hafnium Oxide-containing Nanoparticles NBTXR3|HAFNIUM OXIDE|NBTXR3,"A suspension of nanoparticles containing inert inorganic hafnium oxide (HfO2) crystals with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon injection of NBTXR3 in the tumor, the hafnium oxide-containing nanoparticles accumulate into the tumor cells. Subsequent application of radiation beams to the tumor tissue causes HfO2 particles to emit huge amounts of electrons. This results in the formation of free radicals within the tumor cells, which in turn causes targeted destruction of the cancer cells. Compared to standard radiotherapy, because of the inert nature of NBTXR3, this agent emits electrons only during its exposure to radiation which improves radiotherapy efficiency.",Hafnium Oxide-containing Nanoparticles NBTXR3,Pharmacologic Substance,CTRP Agent Terminology|CTRP Terminology|FDA Established Names and Unique Ingredient Identifier Codes Terminology|GDC Terminology|GDC Therapeutic Agent Terminology|GDC Value Terminology|NCI Drug Dictionary Terminology|NCIt Antineoplastic Agent Terminology
C98288,C129821,SNS01-T Nanoparticles|SNS01-T,"A colloidal mixture of nanoparticles consisting of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the native eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), plasmids expressing a pro-apoptotic mutant of elF5A under the control of a B-cell specific promoter (B29), and a synthetic cationic polymer polyethylenimine (PEI) as a delivery vehicle, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, the siRNA component of SNS01-T suppresses elF5A expression, thereby interfering with translation of eIF5A and reducing levels of hypusinated elF5A in cancer cells. In turn, this inhibits activation of the transcription factor NF-kB and induces apoptosis. In addition, the B-cell specific plasmid component expresses an arginine substituted form of eIF5A, eIF5AK50R, which can not be hypusinated, thus leads to a selective induction of apoptosis in B-cells. The native unhypusinated form of eIF5A is pro-apoptotic and can be modified at the lysine residue, by deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) and subsequently deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DHH), to the anti-apoptotic hypusinated form which is associated with tumor cell growth and survival. The delivery vehicle protects the siRNA and plasmid from degradation.",SNS01-T Nanoparticles,Pharmacologic Substance,CTRP Agent Terminology|CTRP Terminology|GDC Terminology|GDC Therapeutic Agent Terminology|GDC Value Terminology|NCI Drug Dictionary Terminology|NCIt Antineoplastic Agent Terminology
